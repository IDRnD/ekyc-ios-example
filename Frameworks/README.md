# Frameworks Folder

This folder is used for storing frameworks required for this project.  

## Instructions:

- Ensure you follow the installation steps in the main project [README.md](../README.md).

>**Note:** This folder is intentionally empty in Git and ignored by `.gitignore`. Frameworks should not be committed to the repository.
